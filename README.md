# Transformer Architecture Deep Dive

My plan with going through the architecture of the Transformer is through different sub-modules of complexity and the level of detail I go into.

I first started with getting a basic understanding of the Transformer architecture in the [0-intro](./0-intro/README.md) directory.

Then, I went into the sub-modules of the Transformer as part of my deep dive marathon. Documenting it all in the [1-diving-deeper](./1-diving-deeper/README.md) directory right now.

All the resources I have used so far are in the respective README files of the directories.

I will update this README as I go along.

Happy learning!
